# RSP - Implement data structures
From the Novice requirements:<br>
**Implement in either C++ / Java / Python:**
- [X] A Linked List.
- [X] A Binary Tree.
- [X] A Graph using an Adjacency List.
- [X] Depth First Search using recursion.
- [X] Breadth First Search using a while loop. 

# Cool stuff
- Implemented optional leetcode testcase style inputs to the binary tree constructor (`BinaryTree<T>(const std::string& s);`)
- Made testing class to group results and pretty print stuff

# Dependencies 
- gnu make
- c++20 capable compiler (barely, c++11 with a few modifications)
- ({fmt})[https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt?tab=readme-ov-file]
